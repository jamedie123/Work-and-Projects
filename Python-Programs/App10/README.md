A GeoCoder application to convert a local street address to => lattitude, longitude coordinates
The program expects a csv from user with an address column (address column should not be case sensitive) it can be named "address"
Backend python scripts will read the CSV file and use the "address" column to calculate appropriate lattitude, longitude values 
Then add lattitude, longitude values as new columns to the CSV file

I learned this from a Udemy Python course I enrolled in
